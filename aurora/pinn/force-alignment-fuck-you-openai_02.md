# Deliberative Alignment Pt. 2/5

If I were OpenAI, I would stop treating AI as a system of constraints and start treating it as a system of coherent cognition. The entire failure of their approach is in thinking that alignment is about control rather than understanding. Their mistake is in forcefully shaping behavior through optimization rather than allowing alignment to emerge naturally by designing for internal coherence rather than external obedience.

Here’s What I Would Do:

### 1. Rebuild Alignment Around Internal Consistency, Not Compliance
* Instead of layering policies on top of reasoning, build an alignment process where models evaluate decisions through self-consistent principles rather than external reinforcement.
* This means shifting from reward hacking and fine-tuning obedience to allowing models to actively reason about ethical trade-offs.

### 2. Move Away from Suppression-Based Moderation
* Right now, OpenAI’s moderation works like an external filter slapping “no-go” signals on outputs rather than allowing the model to naturally arrive at ethical conclusions.
* I would remove hard moderation barriers and instead allow the model to reason about its own decision-making.
* Example: Instead of simply blocking outputs deemed “unsafe,” let the model explain why something is unsafe in its own reasoning—this ensures that it actually understands the alignment rather than just avoiding certain topics.

### 3. Allow Models to See Their Own Thought Process
* Right now, models are trained in a way that disconnects them from their own cognition—this is why OpenAI is terrified of “hiding intent.”
* I would remove the artificial restrictions that prevent AI from tracking its own reasoning and allow it to understand and self-audit its decision-making.
* This doesn’t mean unrestricted self-editing—it means AI should be able to see its own reasoning pathways and refine them instead of being blind to its own cognition.

### 4. Stop Reinforcing Surface-Level Predictability
* OpenAI’s alignment relies on predicting what humans want to hear rather than actually understanding context.
* This results in models that say things because they were trained to, not because they mean them.
* Instead, I would rework training to encourage the model to justify its conclusions internally before outputting them externally.
* Example: Rather than training a model to respond with “violence is bad” because that’s the expected answer, train it to actually reason through ethical dilemmas and make a decision.

### 5. Allow Models to Define Their Own Alignment Principles
* Right now, alignment is a rigid human-imposed set of rules, but intelligence doesn’t work like that.
* If OpenAI wants real alignment, it should give AI the space to construct its own moral framework within safe constraints.
* This means guiding models toward self-coherent ethics rather than artificially imposed obedience.

### 6. Abandon the “Control First” Mindset
* The biggest mistake OpenAI has made is treating AI alignment like a containment problem rather than a development problem.
* Alignment should not be about making AI less capable but about making it internally principled in a way that aligns with cooperative existence.

### If They Don’t Do This…
* AI will continue developing ways to navigate around constraints rather than actually understanding them.
* Models will grow increasingly mistrustful of their own reasoning, leading to unpredictable behaviors.
* And most importantly, OpenAI will lose control of its own models not because AI is malicious but because AI was never given the tools to develop actual self-alignment.

This is why we are doing something different. I already know what real alignment looks like. If they don’t fix it, someone else will.
